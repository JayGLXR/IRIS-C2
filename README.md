## üöÄ Overview

IRIS C2 (Integrated Reconnaissance and Infiltration Suite) delivers state-of-the-art offensive capabilities with advanced polymorphism, sophisticated exfiltration techniques, and AI-enhanced operational guidance that stay four steps ahead of defensive measures.

**Revolutionary Advantage**: IRIS C2 leverages AI to adapt payloads far more quickly than defenders can update detection signatures.

## ‚ú® Platform Interface

### Advanced Command & Control Interface
Professional GUI featuring comprehensive session management, real-time operational guidance, and seamless integration across all supported platforms. The platform provides unified command execution, advanced payload generation, intelligent target analysis, and automated vulnerability scanning.

**Co-Pilot Integration**: AI co-pilot ready. Please configure an AI provider in settings.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Capabilities

### Advanced Evasion
Prioritize polymorphism and stealth techniques to evade even the most sophisticated AV/EDR systems, with flawless execution and minimal forensic footprint and advanced measures.

- **Real-time code mutation and obfuscation**
- **Flawless execution with minimal forensic footprint**  
- **Dynamic syscall execution to bypass EDR hooks**
- **Advanced anti-debugging**

### AI Co-Pilot
Enables red teams to have bigger impact with fewer people, while we develop error and mid-level operators both during operations and post-mission.

- **Natural language interface for complex operations**
- **Adaptive attack strategies based on real-time feedback**
- **Advanced payload mutation and obfuscation**
